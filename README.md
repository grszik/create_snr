# Create: Sweets 'n' Treats (*Reforged*)
Unofficial version of SNR for Forge. Keep in mind this is not a 1:1 copy, but a remake - some recipes or item names/ids might be different.
## Foods
Offers Muffins, Donuts, Pies, Rock Candy, Gumdrops, Sugar Cookies, Cinder Bread, Cinder Rolls and Gunpowder Cakes (definitely safe to eat). The first three also have different flavours: Apple Syrup, Sweet, Honeyed and Chocolate.
## Decorational blocks
Even though the official version has them, this one doesn't yet.
## Dependencies
Requires Create 0.5.1.
